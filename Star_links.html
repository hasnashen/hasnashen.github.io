    <p> ✩ These are all about my favourite stars ✩ </p>
    <h3> ⋆ K-pop ⋆ </h3>
        <h4>I enjoy listening to K-pop songs and watch their vocal conserts in my spare time. I buy their albums and their photocards every two months. 
            I love WINTER in aespa the most! She loves nature and is also kind and beautiful. Her stage presence is so strong, and she always strives 
            to present her best self to her fans through different stage outfits and songs. Her clear voice captivates me, and my favorite song of hers is her solo "Spark." 
            Besides, I love G-Dragon in Bigbang too. G-Dragon composes and writes for BIGBANG and his solo works. His music's melodies and meaningful lyrics deeply move me. 
            He's brave, even mocking unfair organizers on stage, yet surprisingly shy. His positive personality inspires me.
            I also love the songs of ILLIT, IVE, AESPA and BIGBANG the most：） </h4>
