        <h2>❤ My Family ❤</h2>

        <p>♡ These are all about my family ♡</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Me</li>
            <li>My father</li>
            <li>My mother</li>
            <li>My sister</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My family consists of my parents, my younger sister, and me. My father is a talented man who is great at drawing and cooking. 
            He's a fixer-upper with a fun sense of humor, always making time to play with us. 
            My mother is also a gifted artist and a true artist in the kitchen, specializing in delicious desserts. 
            She is very caring, always looking after our health and our outfits. I enjoy chatting, 
            joking and going shopping with her (even though we usually have different ideas)..My creative younger sister is a mix of adorable and annoying---
            we fight sometimes，but we also play together and share countless jokes. I deeply admire her social skills. Overall, 
            I just love being with my family.</p>

        <h4>I've traveled to many places like Japan, Thailand, the UK, and Spain. Every destination left a strong impression and taught me 
            something new about different cultures. My favorites are China and Japan. China is so big that I've only seen half of it, 
            and I'm eager to explore more of its provinces and cities to experience various ethnic cultures. I also want to revisit my hometown, 
            Taiwan and Gansu--Taiwan for all the fun memories, and Gansu for the many warm relatives there. Even though I've been to Japan about seven times, 
            I still hope to go back to wear a kimono and see a major fireworks show. Besides, I have two more big goals: to see my favorite K-pop idol 
            and join their concerts in South Korea, and to see the amazing auroras in Iceland.</h4>

        <h4>I enjoy listening to K-pop songs and watch their vocal conserts in my spare time. I buy their albums and their photocards every two months. 
            I love WINTER in aespa the most! She loves nature and is also kind and beautiful. Her stage presence is so strong, and she always strives 
            to present her best self to her fans through different stage outfits and songs. Her clear voice captivates me, and my favorite song of hers is her solo "Spark." 
            Besides, I love G-Dragon in Bigbang too. G-Dragon composes and writes for BIGBANG and his solo works. His music's melodies and meaningful lyrics deeply move me. 
            He's brave, even mocking unfair organizers on stage, yet surprisingly shy. His positive personality inspires me.
            I also love the songs of ILLIT, IVE, AESPA and BIGBANG the most：） </h4>

        <h4>I enjoy watching anime on weekends and holidays. All kinds of genres grab my interest because the characters are so vivid and unique. 
            In action anime, each character has amazing magical or supernatural abilities. In detective anime, the characters are keen observers, 
            with Conan being a classic example. The stories between the main characters under sakura (cherry blossom trees) in romance anime are also very warm and romantic. 
            There are many other types as well. By watching them, I feel as if I'm personally experiencing the lives of people in another dimension, 
            a world different from my own. Sometimes, I cosplay my favorite characters, just like stepping into their roles.</h4>
