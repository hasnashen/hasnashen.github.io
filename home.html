        <p>♡ These are all about my family ♡</p>

            <li>My sister</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are four family members in my family, they’re my father, my mother, my sister and I. My FATHER
            is good at
            drawing and cooking. He likes repairing things by himself. He’s humorous and often plays with my sister and
            me.
            My MOTHER is good at drawing too. She is good at making desserts. She cares a lot about my sister and me's
            health and the clothes we wear when we go out every day.
            My SISTER is younger than me. She’s creative. Sometimes she is lovely but sometimes she is annoying. We
            always
            play or fight together, and we have a lot of topics. She has excellent social skills, which I envy…
            I love staying with my family.</p>
