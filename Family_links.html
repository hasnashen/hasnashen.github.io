    <h1>My Family</h1>
    <a href="home.html">Home Page</a>
    <p>♡ These are all about my family ♡</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Me</li>
        <li>My father</li>
        <li>My mother</li>
        <li>My sister</li>
    </ul>
    <p>My family consists of my parents, my younger sister, and me. My father is a talented man who is great at drawing and cooking. 
        He's a fixer-upper with a fun sense of humor, always making time to play with us. 
        My mother is also a gifted artist and a true artist in the kitchen, specializing in delicious desserts. 
        She is very caring, always looking after our health and our outfits. I enjoy chatting, 
        joking and going shopping with her (even though we usually have different ideas)..My creative younger sister is a mix of adorable and annoying---
        we fight sometimes，but we also play together and share countless jokes. I deeply admire her social skills. Overall, 
        I just love being with my family.</p>
