    <h1>Things I like to do during my spare time.</h1>
    <a href="home.html">Home Page</a>


    <p class="section-title">1. Playing the Piano</p>
    <h3>Piano has been my main hobby in my spare time for over a decade now. Having played for 
eleven years, it's more than just practice—it's my personal space to express 
myself. The keys feel familiar,and getting lost in a piece is the perfect way to clear 
my head after a long day.</h3>

    <p class="section-title">2. Listening to Music</p>
    <h3>I also like listening to music. I listen to 
        all kinds of songs. Different music can match and regulate my different moods.</h3>
        <a href="Music_links.html">Click Here!!! This page will share you some of my favourite music. </a>

    <p class="section-title">3. Painting</p>
    <h3>drawing is an activity that can calm me down. It allows me to enjoy the process of gradually 
        presenting the characters in my heart on paper.</h3>

    <p class="section-title">4. Chatting with friends</p>
    <h3>Chatting with friends is also an important part. Whether it's sharing recent 
        interesting stories or chatting about trivial daily matters, the relaxed communication 
        always makes me feel happy and fulfilled.</h3>

    <p class="section-title">5. Watching Anime</p>
    <h3>I often watch anime when I'm resting. The exciting plot and unique visual style are 
        very attractive to me. It is both entertainment and often offers some interesting 
        perspectives.</h3>

    <p class="section-title">6. Following my favorite celebrity online</p>
    <h3>I also enjoy keeping up with all kinds of content from my favorite idols：their stage 
        performances, interviews, and daily vlogs.</h3>

    <p class="section-title">7. Playing Video Games</p>
